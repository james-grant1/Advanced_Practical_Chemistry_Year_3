    "From a given starting position, what distance is our dye molecule likely to travel after 1000 steps? This can be determined simply by adding together the steps, taking into account the fact that steps backwards subtract from the total, while steps forward add to the total. Since both forward and backward steps are equally probable, we come to the surprising conclusion that the probable distance travelled sums up to zero.\n",
